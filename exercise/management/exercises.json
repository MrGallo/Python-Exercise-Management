In Python, this is achieved using the `print()` function. The `print()` function will will output anything you want to the terminal screen (it does not activate your printer). \n\n\n### Your task\n1. Run the starter code to see an example of what it looks like to print something to the terminal. The code, as it is, should output the following:\n    ```\n    Hello,\n    ```\n2. In addition to the output that is already there, make the program print out `\"World!\"`. The result should look like:\n    ```\n    Hello,\n    World!\n    ```",
