In Python, this is achieved using the `print()` function. The `print()` function will will output anything you want to the terminal screen (it does not activate your printer). \n\nRun the starter code to see an example of what it looks like to print something to the terminal.\n\n### Your task\nIn addition to the print statement that is already there, make the program print out `\"world!\"`. The result should look like:\n\n```\nHello,\nWorld!\n```",
