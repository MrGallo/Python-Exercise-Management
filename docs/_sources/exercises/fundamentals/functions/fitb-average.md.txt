# FITB Average

**Topic:** 
```eval_rst
:ref:`fundamentals:defining a function`

```



Whoever wrote the starter code could not think of a good name to call their function. We need to fix that. Give the function a name of `calc_average`.

## Starter Code
```python
def _____(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

## Tests
```python
from main import calc_average


def test_calc_average():
    assert calc_average([1, 2, 3]) == 2
```
