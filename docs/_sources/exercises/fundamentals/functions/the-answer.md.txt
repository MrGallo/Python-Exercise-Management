What is The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything? Apparently, it's the number `42`. The starter code has defined a function `get_answer_to_everything` which returns the number `42`. Your job is to call the function and store it in a variable called `the_answer`. Then, print out `the_answer` in a message.

## Starter Code
```python
def get_answer_to_everything() -> int:
    return 42


# your code down here (outside of the function)
```

## Tests
```python

```
