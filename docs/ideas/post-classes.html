  <p>You did it! You neutralized that Icy-blue eyed agent code name <em>whatever</em>-Llama. Too bad for him, he will be promptly removed from <em>The Agency</em> by the high command. No questions asked.</p>
<p>“You don’t mess with a hacker (intern)” you say to yourself. “Serves him right for trying to out me as a noob.”</p>
<p>You yell out in relieved excitement “TAKE THAT YOU…”</p>
<p><em>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK</em></p>
<p>Who could that be? Hopefully they didn’t hear you yelling like a maniac. They probably did, but you can’t pretend you aren’t here. You walk over to open the door and you are greeted by a man in a perfectly tailored suit (Gucci?). Must be one of the stuffy agents that are constantly crawling around this place. You look up to see a smiling face with chilling icy-blue eyes. Those <em>same</em> blue eyes that have been looking at you strangely over the last little while.</p>
<p>Your entire body freezes stiff, unable to breathe. <em>IT’S HIM! THE AGENT!</em>. In a split second every horrible scenario runs through your head of what this agent is capable of doing you. In a panic you peer past him into the hall hoping to find a witness. There is no one else around.</p>
<p><em>Surely, he couldn’t possibly know what I just did!</em></p>
<p>“Hello” the smiling man says, “I knew you could do it!”</p>
<p>“Uhh… wha?” is all you can manage to say.</p>
<p>“Oh, please pardon my manners” the agent says. “William Buckley, code-name: Gracious Llama, but you can call me Bill.”</p>
<p>You wonder why he is being so nice considering what he knows about you.</p>
<p>“You see, I was the one who sent you that message helping you out a while back.” You stare at the man, your mouth gaping open, not quite sure what he means. “The secret message. You had previously made a name-tag function for the Scranton branch party. You made a function <em>outside</em> of the Agent class rather than an instance method <em>inside</em> the Agent class.”</p>
<p>Mouth open, head spinning, you try to make sense of it all. <em>Isn’t this the agent trying to get me fired? Or worse? What’s he doing sending me notes helping me?</em></p>
<p>“I helped you fix it. You did it!” he repeats, “I knew you could. You see, I was a hacker intern like you once.”</p>
<p>You barely catch the last part about some “intern like you” or something, your mind spinning, thinking back to the job-saving message which was signed G.L.</p>
<p>“Gracious Llama?!? That was you?” you ask trying to keep yourself from exploding.</p>
<p>“Indeed. I know the game here, kid. They expect a little too much from…” he trails off as you enter full-blown panic-mode.</p>
<p><em>Oh no!</em> you think. <em>OH NOOOOOO</em>! You feel your right leg buckle slightly, panicked weakness pouring over your whole body. You finally manage to get out something intelligible “I.. I.. Ummm yea, thanks. Silly me!” You laugh nervously as you bonk your head in a display of stupidity.</p>
<p>You manage to compose yourself. “Than.. Thank you. Gracious.. umm, Bill” you say shaking your head slightly as you extend your arm for a hand shake.</p>
<p>“Looking forward to working with you, kid” Bill says with a curteous nod before leaving.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you too!” you say ernestly, trembling, nervously massaging the back of your head with your right hand.</p>
<p>“Oh and one last thing” Bill turns around trying to suppress a smile.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Try to stay away from Stack Overflow for a while? Maybe brush up a bit more so I don’t have to come saving your behind again!”</p>
<p>“Ha!” you laugh, somewhat forced “of course!” you say, a nervous smile creeping at the side of your mouth.</p>
<p>Bill walks away with a loud chuckle. “I’m headed to my latest performance-review with High Command. Wish me luck!”</p>
<p>Your stomach sinks and it takes some effort to remain standing on account of your (now two) buckling legs. You quickly close your door and run to your computer.</p>
<p>YOU NEED TO FIX THIS…</p>
<p>To Be Continued…</p>
