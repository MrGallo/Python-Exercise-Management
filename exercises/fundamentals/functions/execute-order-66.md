# Execute order 66

**Topic:** 
```eval_rst
:ref:`fundamentals:calling a function`

```



In the starter code, we have defined a function called `order_66`. Supreme-Chancellor Palpatine (who *is* the senate) came up with a plan to destroy the Jedi in one fell-swoop. He called this plan "Order 66". The plan was not executed right away. Palpatine waited for the right time and when that time came, he executed the order.

In order for you to execute the function called `order_66`, you must call it's name with parenthesis below where it is defined. Replace the comment below the function and call the function with the following code:

```python
order_66()
```

Be careful **not** to indent this call. That would make it *part* of the function itself and Order 66 would never be executed.

## Starter Code
```python
def order_66():
    print("Executing Order 66:")
    print()
    print("Telling clones to attack the Jedi...")
    print("Assuming they will listen...")
    print("(apparently they had some bio-chip installed)")
    print("Most of the Jedi have been eliminated.")
    print("... except those Jedi that would provide convenient successive expanded-universe story-lines.")


# call the function here (watch your indent level)
```

## Tests
```python

```
