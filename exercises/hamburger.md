# Hamburger

With the starter code (given in `main.py`) your program outputs an empty hamburger. You goal is to create a complete hamburger.

1. Run the program and observe the output. It should be as follows:
    ```
    (--Bun--)

    (--Bun--)
    ```
    Notice the empty space. This empty line comes from the empty `print()` function.
2. Place the string `"Hamburger"` inside that empty `print()` function.
