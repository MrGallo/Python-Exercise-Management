# monkey_trouble





We have two monkeys, a and b. First ask the user if `monkey a` is smiling, then ask the user if `monkey b` is smiling.  We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling. Output a message to the user telling them if we are in trouble. For the test cases below, `False` means "no" and `True` means "yes".
