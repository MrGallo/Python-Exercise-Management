# con_cat




Given two strings, append them together (known as "concatenation") and return the result. However, if the concatenation creates a double-char, then omit one of the chars, so "abc" and "cat" yields "abcat".

This exercise was taken from [codingbat.com](https://codingbat.com/prob/p132118) and has been adapted for the Python language. There are many great programming exercises there, but the majority are created for Java.
