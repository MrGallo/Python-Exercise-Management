```

This exercise was taken from [codingbat.com](https://codingbat.com/prob/p167011) and has been adapted for the Python language. There are many great programming exercises there, but the majority are created for Java.

## Starter Code
```python
from typing import List


def make_pi() -> List[int]:
    pass


result = make_pi()
print(result)
```

## Tests
```python
from main import make_pi


def test_make_pi_1():
    assert make_pi() == [3, 1, 4]
```
