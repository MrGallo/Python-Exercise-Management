Run the starter code to see an example of what it looks like to print something to the terminal. The code, as it is, should output the following:\n    ```\n    Hello,\n    ```\n2. In addition to the output that is already there, make the program print out `\"World!\"`. The result should look like:\n    ```\n    Hello,\n    World!\n    ```\n\n",

If we want to actually include a quote in a string, we need to **escape** that quote with the escape character `\\`. This will tell Python to skip over that particular quote and not to use it to end the string.\n2. Go back to `main.py` and comment-out line 2 by putting a number-sign (hashtag) infront of the line.

Use the escape character (`\\`) to allow the second print statement to include the quotes. Be sure to use the first print statement as an example for how to do this correctly. Also, remember to un-comment the second print statement, when you are ready to run it.
