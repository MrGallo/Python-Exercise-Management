If we want to actually include a quote in a string, we need to **escape** that quote with the escape character `\\`. This will tell Python to skip over that particular quote and to not use it to end the string.\n2. Comment-out the second print statement by putting a number-sign (hashtag) infront of the line. For example:\n    ```python\n    # print(...)\n    ```\n3. Run the program and observe what the first print statement outputs. Notice:\n    - there is no error,\n    - the output actually contains the quote characters\n    - what is output to the terminal doesn't actually contain the escape characters `\\`.\n4. Use the escape character (`\\`) to allow the second print statement to include the quotes. Be sure to use the first print statement as an example for how to do this correctly. Also, remember to un-comment the second print statement, when you are ready to run it.
